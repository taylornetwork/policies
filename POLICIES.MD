# Payments

Payments can be made online by Credit Card or Bank Account by following the instructions on the invoice that was sent. 
Alternatively, we also accept payment via INTERAC e-Transfer. If you would like to pay using this method, see the included directions on the bottom of your invoice, be sure to include the invoice number in the messages section when you send payment. 

# Definitions

## Third-Party Fees

Any fee that we incur with a third-party on your behalf we may bill directly to you. We have no control over these fees and they are subject to change without notice.

### Fees in Other Currencies

Some third-party fees may be in other currencies and when we incur the expense we pay an exchange rate.
We will bill the third-party fee in CAD, as close as we can to what we paid including the exchange rate, this is not perfect and will occasionally be more or less than what we paid.
We may change the amount at any time in order to keep up with changing currency exchange rates.

## Balance Forward

When there are multiple unpaid invoices on your account and you make a payment, the payment will be applied to the unpaid invoices in order from most overdue to least overdue. A [late fee](#late-fees) may apply.

## Late Fees

If unpaid invoices are not paid in full by the due date, they may be subject to a late fee. Late fees are taxable, charged per invoice.

### Calculation

| Amount Overdue | Base Fee | Plus % of Invoice Total |
|:--------------:|:--------:|:-----------------------:|
| <90 Days | $3 | 3% |
| 90 to 180 Days | $5 | 5% |
| >180 Days<sup>(1)</sup> | $7 | 7% |

*<sup>(1)</sup> Invoices >180 days overdue may be sent to collections in addition to the increased fee.*

### Location

In the event you receive a late fee, it will appear in one of two places depending on the type of invoice that is late. 

**Regular Invoices**: The invoice will be modified and an updated version with the charge will be sent.

**Recurring Invoices**: The charge will appear on the next invoice.

## Non-Payment

An invoice is considered in `Non-Payment` when

1. the invoice's create and due dates are different and the invoice is past due, or
2. the invoice's create and due dates are the same and the invoice is over 7 days past due.

After an invoice that was in `Non-Payment` has been paid, the status is removed.

We may maintain a log of invoices that went into `Non-Payment` and take action via [Account Suspension](#account-suspension) or [Termination](#account-termination) if subsequent invoices go into also go into `Non-Payment`.

### Repeated Non-Payments

If multiple invoices are in [Non-Payment](#non-payment) at the same time, or you have let multiple invoices go into [Non-Payment](#non-payment) over the course of your time using our services, you may be subject to an [Account Suspension](#account-suspension) or [Termination](#account-termination).

## Account Suspension

In the event you are subject to an account suspension, you will

1. be sent a Notice of Potiential Suspension (via email), and
2. be sent instructions on steps to rectify any issues, and
3. be given between 3 to 7 business days to provide solutions to avoid suspension.

> Suspending accounts is not something we want to do, if there are some glaring issues that may lead to your suspension, and you are unable to complete some of the steps to rectify the issues, contact us. 
> We want to work with you in order to have a good mutual relationship. Ideally, we don't want to suspend anyone.

In the event that you do not rectify any and all issues that led to your account suspension, we will suspend your account. We will

1. send you Notice of Suspension (via email), and
2. redirect all traffic from your website (if applicable) to 
    1. our website, or
    2. a generic "Service Unavailble" page, or
    3. a page stating that issues that need to be rectified, and
3. block your access to all of our services (if applicable).

Once you have followed the steps to rectify the issues that led to the suspension we will fully reinstate your account. 

In the event that issues are not rectified within a reasonable amount of time (set out in the notice email), we may [terminate](#account-termination) your account.

## Account Termination

> Terminating an account is a drastic action that we do not take lightly. 
> We don't ever want to have to do this and thus far have not ever had to. 
> In the event you face suspension or termination, we are willing to work with you to get back on track.

We may terminate your account if

1. your account has been suspended longer than the reasonable time set out in the notice of suspension, or
2. you make threats, assault (verbally, physically, sexually, etc.), intimidate any of our employees, contractors, affiliates.

In the event your account is terminated, we will

1. send you a Notice of Termination (via email), and
2. remove all data associated with your account on all our servers (if applicable), and
3. sell any assets held by us at market rate, and
4. close any unpaid invoices to be consolidated, and
5. send you a Final Invoice that will include
    1. total consolidated balances of any unpaid invoices (if applicable), and
    2. any unpaid work that was not yet invoiced (if applicable), and
    3. a fee for Account Termination, the larger amount of
        1. $500, or
        2. 25% of all unpaid invoices consolidated on this invoice,
6. give you 30 days to pay the Final Invoice in full.

After 30 days, if the Final Invoice remains unpaid, we will send it to collections, and/or take action via a claims court.
